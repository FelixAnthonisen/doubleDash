# Intro

Double Dash is a 2D platformer game where the aim of the game is to clear all levels in as few deaths as possible. A level is composed of several obstacles including walkable and climbable platforms, spikes which kill the player and powerups which reset the players dash. Just as a heads up, the game is supposed to be hard. Just don't give up if it feels challenging, the thrill of completing a hard level is worth the struggle of getting there!

# Gameplay

There are four main ways of movement in the game. The player may run horisontally, climb walls, jump, and dash while mid air. If you fall into the void at the bottom or touch a spike the player will die. To clear a level you need to navigate and touch the green portal blocks. You can dash in 8 different directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW) and if you dash you may only dash once until the player is grounded again, or if he touches the yellow powerup.

# Quick control guide

- Use A, D to move horisontally both while on the ground or in air
- Space makes the player jump if they are currently on the ground or climbing a wall
- Pressing M while midair will dash the player. The combinations of WASD keys held down determines which direction the player will dash in
- Walking up to a wall while pressing A or D in the direction of the wall will allow the player to grab onto the wall. Pressing W or S while on the wall will make the player climb up or down
- R may be pressed at any time to make the player respawn at the beginning of the current level. There is a rare bug that a player can get soft locked when dashing into the corner of a block. If this happens the respawn should be used
